### 🔹 **Autoencoder for Unsupervised Feature Extraction** | *Python, NumPy*

- Extracted **compact and meaningful representations** from natural images without labeled data  
- Implemented a single-layer autoencoder with **Tikhonov regularization** and **KL divergence**  
- Preprocessed inputs with **grayscale conversion**, **mean normalization**, and **pixel scaling**  
- Trained using **mini-batch gradient descent**

---

### 🔹 **Neural Network-Based Language Model** | *Python, NumPy*

- Designed a **feedforward network** to predict the next word from trigram inputs  
- Used **shared word embeddings**, **sigmoid hidden layer**, and **softmax output**  
- Trained with **mini-batch SGD with momentum** and **early stopping**  
- Evaluated using **top-10 prediction accuracy** on unseen trigrams

### 🔹 **Human Activity Recognition with RNN, LSTM, and GRU** | *Python, NumPy*

- Classified physical activities using **multivariate time-series data** from motion sensors  
- Implemented and compared **RNN**, **LSTM**, and **GRU** architectures trained with **BPTT**  
- Used **Xavier initialization** and **Adam optimizer**  
- **GRU achieved the best performance with 86.5% test accuracy**
