### ðŸ”¹ Autoencoder for Unsupervised Feature Extraction | Python, NumPy

- Extracted compact and meaningful representations from natural images without labeled data  
- Implemented a single-layer autoencoder with **Tikhonov regularization** and **KL divergence**  
- Preprocessed inputs with grayscale conversion, mean normalization, and pixel scaling  
- Trained using mini-batch gradient descent

### ðŸ”¹ Neural Network-Based Language Model | Python, NumPy

- Designed a feedforward network to predict the next word from trigram inputs  
- Used shared word embeddings, sigmoid hidden layer, and softmax output  
- Trained with mini-batch SGD with momentum and early stopping  
- Evaluated using top-10 prediction accuracy on unseen trigrams

### ðŸ”¹ Human Activity Recognition with RNN, LSTM, and GRU | Python, NumPy

- Classified physical activities using multivariate time-series data from motion sensors  
- Implemented and compared RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures trained with BPTT  
- Used Xavier initialization and Adam optimizer  
- GRU achieved the best performance with **86.5% test accuracy**
